## POM-Dependency-Parser

Deployed version at https://pom-parser.vercel.app

This tool is designed to
enhance and simplify your development workflow by offering a
user-friendly interface for handling your project's
dependencies.

To ensure a secure and seamless login experience, our
application seamlessly integrates with GitHub for user
authentication through OAuth 2.0. Once authenticated, users
are directed to the home page where they can explore all
their public repositories. From there, they can easily
select the repository of interest to retrieve and manage all
the POM dependencies associated with it.
